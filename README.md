# G-factor-based external bias limiter (GERBIL)
====

## Overview
G-factor-based external bias limiter (GERBIL) is a scheme for regulating biased sampling

## Description
To regulate biased sampling a well-established structural indicator (the G-factor) was used to obtain structural information. Based on the G-factor, we proposed a scheme for regulating biased sampling, which is referred to as a G-factor-based external bias limiter (GERBIL). With GERBIL, the configurations were structurally validated by the G-factor during biased sampling. As an example of biased sampling, an accelerated MD simulation (aMD) was adopted in GERBIL (aMD-GERBIL), whereby the aMD was repeatedly performed by increasing the strength of the boost potential.
